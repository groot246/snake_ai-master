# Description
This is my first repository.  
This AI is a Snake game AI developed using the Minimax algorithm, and it follows the same rules as the original Snake game.   
What sets it apart from other repositories is that the AI's learning results are "recorded" in a text file.   
As a result, it can remember its previous learning even after being restarted.   
However, sometimes a strange number "9223372036854775807" gets recorded, and the snake follows its own tail with a gap of 1 cell.   
This number also appears frequently in other Minimax algorithms.   
I have attempted to fix this issue, but have not succeeded so far.   
If anyone is familiar with this error, please let me know.  

# TO DO
1. Add score calculation UI  
2. Fix the 922 error
